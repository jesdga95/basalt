# Running the server

Settings: [configuration](configuration/index.md). Diagnostic flags: `bin/basalt --help`. Several models: [models and the router](configuration/models.md).

## Start-up

The page is up at once and the model loads behind it. The header reads `Loading` with the percent over a progress bar while weights load; choosing a model in the picker loads it. `/health` and `/metrics`
show the load. A failed start-up load ends the server. Requests wait during a load and get a 503 if it fails.

## Concurrent requests: `--parallel N`

`--parallel N` (1 to 8) serves N requests at once in batch slots. Further requests wait in arrival order. `--max-context` is shared:
each slot holds `max-context / N` tokens (`--parallel 4 --max-context 262144` gives four slots of 65,536). A request longer than its slot
is refused with a 400 that names the length. `--slot-full-context` gives every slot the whole `--max-context`, at N times the KV cache.

Each slot keeps two checkpoints (end of the system prompt, last turn), so requests that share a long system prompt read it once.

### Prompts beside decoding slots

A prompt of up to 16,384 tokens is read at once, and the slots wait a few seconds. A longer one is read beside them, on its own thread,
while the slots keep decoding. A short request that arrives meanwhile goes first at the end of the current chunk.

## The console log

Every line starts with `[server]`. Values are `key=value`. Start-up prints a legend, a line per model, `ready`, `loaded`, `kv`, `slots`.
While a prompt is read, a slot prints `pp=<read>/<total>` with the rate. While requests generate, a `live` line appears every 2 s.
Each request ends with one `done` line:

```
[server] s1 done  pp=96/89c 0.1s  tg=1720 119.6t/s acc=65% dl=2.9  ttft=0.1s  end=stop  hit=89.7%  pcie=39.3%
```

- `pp=<prompt tokens>/<cached>c`: the rate counts newly read tokens only.
- `acc`: drafts accepted over drafts offered. `dl`: tokens per window. Both are absent when the request did not draft.
- `end`: `stop`, `length`, `cancelled`, `disconnect` or `error`.
- `hit`: expert cache hit rate. `pcie`: share of routed experts read over PCIe.

The engine's own `basalt ...` lines go to `~/.cache/basalt/<id>/engine.log`, one folder per model file (`<id>` is 16 hex digits
taken from the file); `[server] engine log: PATH` names it when the engine fails to start.

## The stats page

The server's address serves a page, updated every second from `/metrics`, `/slots` and `/api/logs`: GPU load, power, VRAM and temperature,
RAM and disk, decode and prefill rates with 60 s charts, slots, the newest requests, and the console lines.

## Conversations on disk: `--conversation-cache-disk-mib`

Off at 0. With a budget, conversations of at least 8,192 tokens are written to `conversations` in the model's cache folder when they leave
RAM, a session, or at exit. Only the system prompt's and the last three turns' states are stored. Files are bound to the model and settings
they were made with, and checked by hash; a bad file is deleted. The folder is capped by the budget (least recently used first), and a
write always leaves 4 GiB of the volume free. After a restart, a prompt that starts with a stored conversation reads it back.

## Sleep: `--idle-sleep`

After the given seconds without requests, the engine frees its VRAM (the driver moves the GPU state to host memory). The process and its
RAM copy of the experts stay. The next request wakes it in seconds. Linux only. The server stays awake when the GPU state would not fit in
free RAM with 8 GiB to spare. `--idle-unload` ends the process instead.

## Memory floors

Basalt refuses settings that would leave the machine without memory, and never shrinks what you asked for:

- `--vram-reserve-mib` below 256 is refused on Windows and WSL2 (128 on Linux): less free VRAM makes the driver page GPU memory.
- With experts on the SSD, the RAM copy keeps a floor free for the OS file cache (`RAM floor ...` in the start log).
- While serving, the RAM guard parks conversations to disk or drops them when free RAM falls. A request waits up to 30 s for RAM to
  return. A running request stops with an error only when RAM is critical (under 1 GiB free, or below the guard under memory pressure).
- Experts on the SSD give one warning, the same for every model: `N experts on SSD (X GiB) · free X GiB RAM`. The console
  repeats it and the stats page turns its Experts block amber.
- `--no-ram-guard` turns the guard off: nothing is shed, delayed or stopped for low RAM. The disk tier keeps its floor a GiB
  above where the guard would sit.
- `--resident-budget-gib` that would leave less than the floor is refused with the largest safe value.

## Vision: `--vision`

`--vision off | dynamic | cpu | <GPU number>` (config: `"vision"` in `server`). The encoder is Basalt's own, and all modes give bitwise
identical embeddings.

| Mode | Encoder runs | VRAM cost | Fresh-image TTFT (IQ3_S, 400 W): 1k / 3k / 4k image tokens |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `off` | none | none | |
| GPU number | sidecar `bin/basalt-vision` on that card | about 2.2 GiB of its expert cache | 0.77 s / 1.4 s / 1.8 s |
| `dynamic` | inside the engine, on the main GPU | none at rest (0.85 GiB pinned RAM) | 0.77 s / 1.45 s / 1.8 s |
| `cpu` | sidecar on the CPU | none | about 6 s / 40 s / 70 s |

`dynamic` borrows the cache's last slots per image and refills them afterwards (about 70 ms), so the cache is identical after. Which
images a request may name: [image sources](configuration/image-sources.md). An image may not sit in a system prompt.
