// include/basalt/kernels/mid_chain.hpp - a GDN layer's middle as ONE persistent kernel.
//
// qkv + z projections -> recurrence -> output projection, the same operations (and bits) as dense_tc_pair,
// dec_gdn_rec and dense_tc in sequence.  It runs between the layer's two hc reads (which stay hc_fused_read): its input
// is the first read's q8_1 rows and mixed output, its result the output projection's `bo`, which the second read adds.
// One CTA per SM (a device with fewer than 170 SMs runs fewer, each taking more tiles and heads); the phases hand over through counters in global memory.  The kernel needs every CTA resident, so it
// must be launched with the stream drained of kernels that wait on later work (it is a programmatic dependent of the
// first read and the second read is its dependent).  A hand-off wait that passes its bound sets the abort word and
// falls through (wait_abort.hpp).
