// include/basalt/platform/direct_file.hpp - unbuffered asynchronous file reads.
//
// The n-gram table (26.8 GiB) stays on the SSD and must never occupy RAM, including the OS file cache. A memory
// map cannot promise that; an unbuffered read can. Linux reads it with O_DIRECT preads issued from a small thread
// pool (submit only queues), so many reads are in flight. Windows reads the same file with FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING
// overlapped reads completed through an I/O completion port; the queue of reads is the same either way.
//
// Contract of every read: offset, length and buffer address are multiples of `alignment()` (4096 here).
// Reads past end of file return the bytes that exist; `Completion::bytes` says how many.
