// include/basalt/prefill/prefill.hpp - batched prompt processing.
//
// The prompt's positions [pos0, pos0 + n) are processed in chunks of `chunk` tokens through all 48 layers, leaving
// the session state (GDN recurrence and conv state, QSA KV pools and indexer, PLE history) where the token path
// would have left it; the decode loop then continues with the next token.  Per layer: the projections are
// tensor-core GEMMs (quantized weights dequantized to FP16 on the fly, BF16 weights as they are), the recurrences
// walk the chunk inside one kernel, and the routed experts are grouped by expert: resident ones are read from the
// VRAM tier, the others streamed from the host arena through a pinned ring on a copy stream.
//
// Requires the native weights: every quantized projection must carry its GGUF blocks.
