# Engine code writes its log lines through include/basalt/log.hpp, which gives every line its level. This fails when
# code under src/ or include/ names stderr (or cerr, perror) anywhere else, so a line cannot go out without a level.
# Tests, parity checks and microbenchmarks print their own results and are not checked. tools/stderr_logging.allow
# lists the files that still name stderr, with their hit counts (a use that is not a write, or help text); a count may
# only go down, and a lower one fails until the allowlist is lowered to match.
