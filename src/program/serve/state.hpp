//   * positional state - the KV cache of the 12 QSA layers and their pooled indexer keys, the draft layer's KV.  A
//     cell is written once for its position and read only by later positions (the block scores take `dead` for the
//     block being filled, never its pooled row), so rewinding to a position just means writing from there again.
//   * running state - the 36 GDN recurrences and conv histories, each QSA layer's indexer tail (the unfinished
//     block's raw keys) and the PLE's normalized history.  Each describes "everything so far" and cannot be
//     rewound, so a checkpoint is a copy of exactly these, the same set the verifier snapshots to roll
//     back rejected drafts.
